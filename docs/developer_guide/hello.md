# Hello customer

The hello customer is a minimal project with the service :

* `nginx`: with routes_aliases feature
* `openshift-acme`: for get the let’s encrypt SSL certs
* `hello`:
  [hello-openshift](https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/hello-openshift)
  simple app

We may have a lot of hello services with different messages for simulating a lot
of versions of an app or different apps, [see the
doc](https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/hello-openshift).
