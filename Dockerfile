# This Dockerfile is part of the Arnold project. It is used to run Arnold's
# Ansible playbooks for the CI/CD of FUN's infrastructure. These playbooks can
# be run either:
#
# - by developpers on their laptops for configuration (e.g. adding a new
#   customer to the infrastructure),
# - by GitLab for CI/CD operations,
#
# In order to run this container, you will need to provide the following
# environment variables:
#
# - ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASS: used to decrypt vaulted content
# - K8S_AUTH_API_KEY: K8S service account token (required to run ansible k8s plugin)
# - K8S_AUTH_HOST: K8S API host (e.g. https://192.168.1.1:6550)
#
# Optionally, you can pass the following environment variable :
#
# - K8S_AUTH_SSL_CA_CERT_B64 : A base64 encoded CA certificate to authenticate
#   against the K8S API (see ca_cert option in ansible k8s plugin)
