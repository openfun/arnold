# Following a blue-green deployment strategy, for each deployment, we create a
# unique identifier (deployment_stamp) that will be used to create unique
# OpenShift object names & tags and connect them. This identifier starts with a
# "d" and contains the deployment datetime (with seconds precision), e.g.
# d-180611-08h46m30s. Default value is null as it should never be used as is,
# but initiated in a playbook using a "set_fact" task.
deployment_stamp: null

# Similarly to deployment stamps, we make job identifiers unique for each
# running playbook (deploy, create_object) by adding the job datetime (with
# seconds precision) to the job name, e.g.
# richie-collecstatic-j-180611-08h46m30s. Default value is null as it should
# never be used as is, but initiated in a playbook using a "set_fact" task.
job_stamp: null

# We allow multiple versions of the secrets for an application. When defining
# new or modified secrets, you will need to update this value to ensure your DCs
# and jobs point to the relevant version of the secrets for the next deployment.
