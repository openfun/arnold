# Get deployment_stamp from a static service

# An application can define several static services. (e.g. two static services with
# two different ingresses). Our goal here is to get the deployment_stamp of a
# deployed stack by getting a service object. We retrieve the service and it will
# be labelled with the deploy_stamp we are looking for.
