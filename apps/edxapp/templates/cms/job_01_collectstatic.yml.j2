        # we copy service variant configMaps that may override default
        # configuration (docker_run*.py and settings.yml) in that same
        # "/tmp/config" directory. And finally, we also copy sensible
        # credentials from edxapp secret (credentials.vault.yml). When this
        # initContainer shuts down, the "edxapp-config" volume has been filled
        # with all project settings that will be used to run the service variant
        # container. Please refer to the documentation to better understand our
        # settings generation mecanism.

        # FIXME: the last command of this initContainer aims at copying a
        # webpack-stats.json file generated during the build in the STATIC_ROOT.
        # As it cannot be collected and it is required to run this service, we
        # are constrained to copy it from the image's STATIC_ROOT to the statics
        # PVC. We've declared an issue in the edx-platform's bug tracker to
        # better understand the role of this file and its location:
