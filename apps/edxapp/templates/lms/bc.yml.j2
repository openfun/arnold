  # FIXME
  #
  # As mentionned in the official documentation [1]:
  #
  #   Configuration change triggers currently only work when creating a new
  #   BuildConfig. In a future release, configuration change triggers will also
  #   be able to launch a build whenever a BuildConfig is updated.
  #
  # Hence, we must force BuildConfig to always get created with a unique name.
  # This is a temporary solution that needs to be improved as soon as OKD
  # triggers a new build upon BC object update.
  #
